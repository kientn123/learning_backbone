learning_backbone
=================

These projects are from the book [Developing Backbone.js Application](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253).
The purpose is for me to better understand how Backbone.js works and to professionally develop a Backbone.js application.
Along the way of recoding these projects, I'd try to do some modifications and additions in order to further develop my programming skills.
